            Lilly is a cool cat who embodies style, elegance, and laid-back
            cool. The sunglasses and bowtie tell the world, "Look out. I'm one
            cool cat."

            Phineas is bringing back the baroque with this classic ensemble. His
            tricorner hat and waistcoat harken back to a more civilized time,
            adding an old-world charm to this cool, cool kitty.

        This cool cat layout was made as an experiment in responsive design by
        me, Matt Haws.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was put together using semantic HTML and the crazy powerful and
        awesome CSS grid and flex properties.

        I do not own these kitties or the pictures of these kitties. But they
        are all super cool!
      </p>
      <p>
        I do own a cat, actually, and specifically did not include her in this
        project in an attempt to make her jealous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, I think she takes me for granted. I was hoping to make her
        fight a bit for my approval.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>It didn't work.</p>
